# ExtractDataInBuffers
Scripts to extract data in buffers around points

### ExtractingDensityLengthBuffers :
This script allows to extract the total length and the density of linear features 
(ex : roads or rivers) among buffers around points.
It returns a data table containing the point IDs and the values obtained
for the total length (in km) and the density (in km/km²) among buffers

### ExtractingAreaBuffers
This script allows to extract the total area and polygone features 
(ex : lakes) among buffers around points.
It returns a data table containing the point IDs and the values obtained
for the area (in km²) among buffers
